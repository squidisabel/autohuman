Got a question for you about that practical we did with Costello, do you remember what voltage you used when you were charging the capacitor?

  "input" : "What formula?",
  "response" : "R = R0A^1/3 \n And then work out the volume \n With 4/3pir^3 \n Not sure tho"

  "response" : "Np :)"
}, {

}, {
  "input" : "You mean the 1.22 lambda = d sin theta one?",
  "response" : "U can work out the radius easily using the above formula \n And then u know the volume and the \n Mass \n No no \n The radius formula \n Is R=R0A^1/3 \n And the density*volume=mass \n So density = mass/volume \n U know the volume which is 4/3pircubed \n And u know the mass \n Because it's like 12xmass of a proton/neutron \n Plug it in to get density"

  "response" : "Lemme know if it works, I haven't done the question"
}, {
  "input" : "I'm getting 2.9 for the radius but they have 3.1",
  "response" : "Hmm \n Try using like 1.67?"
}, {
  "input" : "Maybe the nucleon size changes depending on the element?",
  "response" : "For the mass"
}, {
  "input" : "But you don't need the mass to work out the radius tho",
  "response" : "Of a proton \n Oh"
}, {
  "input" : "Just the nucleon size and A (which is 14) \n *radius, not size",
  "response" : "Hmm I'm not sure then \n It's pretty close but kinda far :("
}, {
  "input" : "Oh, I think you have to use 1.3 for nucleon radius \n From a different website \n gives you the right answer",

}, {
  "input" : "Don't think so \n Cheers! \n Hey, have you done the Physics homework? \n What's all this stuff with relative speed?!",

  "input" : "Are you allowed to ask for it afterwards? \n The score?",

  "response" : "I'm not sure yet \n Still reading"
}, {
  "input" : "ok \n :((",
  "response" : "Basically \n When interrupts happen \n The CPU has to deal with it right \n So it pushes everything to the stack of the current thread like the stack pointer and the instruction pointer \n It pushes a interrupt stack frame which includes this"
}, {
  "input" : "if an interrupt occurs, thread_yield is called...?",
  "response" : "As well as stuff to deal with the interrupt"
}, {
  "input" : "okayyy",
  "response" : "When an interrupt occurs \n Isn't interrupt then disabled or smth"
}, {
  "input" : "interrupts are disabled in thread_yield i thought",
  "response" : "Lemme read \n I think it yields when an eternal interrupt occursp"
}, {
  "input" : "isn't thread_yield called in an interrupt context sometimes...",
  "response" : "Yea"
}, {
  "input" : "but then it asserts that it's not an interrupt context",
  "response" : "Ok basically \n Interrupt is disabled when external interrupt occurs"
}, {
  "input" : "what is yield_on_return used for \n ohhh",
  "response" : "Basically itâs a flag"
}, {
  "input" : "so if it's true thread yield is called",
  "response" : "Yep \n So thread only yields after external interrupt"
}, {
  "input" : "does a timer interrupt happen every timer tick \n sorry i am confused :((",
  "response" : "Yea"
}, {
  "input" : "why",
  "response" : "Timer interrupt calls thread_ticks \n And that basically triggers the scheduler to schedule a new thread when the time slice expires"
}, {
  "input" : "at every timer tick, timer interrupt occurs which calls thread_ticks",
  "response" : "Ya"
}, {
  "input" : "if thread_tick says that the time slice expired \n scheduler is triggered \n ??? \n so every thread is allocated time_slice time",
  "response" : "After time slice expired \n Thread yields"
}, {
  "input" : "ok",
  "response" : "Ok basically \n Every time a timer interrupts \n The thread ticks increase \n If the thread tick is greater than the time slice \n Then intr_yield_on_return is called \n this will cause the thread to yield"
}, {
  "input" : "does every thread have same time slice",
  "response" : "Yea \n By default its 4"
}, {
  "input" : "void thread_tick (void) [Function] Called by the timer interrupt at each timer tick. It keeps track of thread statistics and triggers the scheduler when a time slice expires. \n doesn't this impy \n timer ticks happen independently of interrupt \n interrupt just occurs every tick",
  "response" : "Wdym"
}, {
  "input" : "thread_tick() is called by the timer interrupt every timer tick",
  "response" : "Yea"
}, {
  "input" : "ohhhh \n get it \n sorry",
  "response" : "Lol"
}, {
  "input" : "thanks kerry yyy",
  "response" : "Nws, gonna go play volleyball and hope all my worries go away lol"
}, {
  "input" : "also why do we need to disable interrupts in scheduler",
  "response" : "We only need to disable for external interrupts"
}, {
  "input" : "like in switching threads",
  "response" : "Ok \n What would happen if you interrupt a thread which it was in the middle of switching threads \n Say for example it pushed like 3 of its registers ont \n Onto the stack"
}, {
  "input" : "then cpu sp points to no stack...? \n also is intr_yieldonreturn is called on the penultimate tick, then next tick, thread yields...? \n no context",
  "response" : "On the 4th tick \n It yields \n Like it should yield right after?"
}, {
  "input" : "but intr_yield onrreturn just sets the flag",
  "response" : "I think it has to do some stuff later before yielding \n Not sure \n Lemme think about the switching threads on"
}, {
  "input" : "like it says if thread_ticks + 1 >= time slice...",
  "response" : "Oh yea \n I think you're right \n It's preempting it"
}, {
  "input" : "also r u writing about switch_threads for q5",

Is it hard? \n Yeah, that's probably a good idea ð\nTo be fair, driving in most big cities seems quite stressful",

  "response" : "1 sec \n Sign up to this for free \n https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-dev-essentials-vs.aspx \n And claim the 3 month pluralsight subscription \n And so the c# course"
}, {
  "input" : "is this it?",
  "response" : "Yeah \n But u don't need to do all of it \n Just the bits you find relevant \n Btw I think easiest way to organise those is to split up the work and do some research \n So one person does intrinsic plagiarism detection and the other does extrinsic plagiarism detection \n Which one do you want to research?"
}, {
  "input" : "whats the difference? \n what compiler do u use for c#",
  "response" : "Visual studio \n It has a built in compiler \n Intrinsic is finding plagiarism without comparing the result to a reference \n Whilst the extrinsic is like comparing it to a reference to find out how similar it is."
}, {
  "input" : "y would u use intrinsic?",
  "response" : "Because if you use extrinsic \n For it to work \n You literally need to store all documents ever recorded \n And that's a lot of data and very inefficient \n Either focus on one or use both"
}, {
  "input" : "tru so how would u find plagiarism without comparing with other data?",
  "response" : "Basically you look at natural language processing"
}, {
  "input" : "i dont think we will have good big computers so intrinsic if we can",
  "response" : "Which is like changes in word use and stuff"
}, {
  "input" : "yh like if the style changes mid paragraph",
  "response" : "Yeah"
}, {
  "input" : "i read the article u sent",
  "response" : "Like teachers can plagiarism by seeing the language children use"
}, {
  "input" : "yh",
  "response" : "Something like that but the complexity varies thoughout a piece"
}, {
  "input" : "so extrinsic would be comparing the work to a previous work they've done and looking for differences?",
  "response" : "Exactly \n It would be like looking how similar a piece of text is to others \n Like if there was a copied and pasted sentence then it would detect it \n Problem with intrinsic is it's less accurate \n And if one person just copies completely a source, it might not detect it"
}, {
  "input" : "yh so probs best to use both?",
  "response" : "Yeah that was my idea \n Create an function that outputs a number between 0 and 100"
}, {
  "input" : "like search for keywords that they've used",
  "response" : "We could use Google's bigquary api \n But I think we should start small"
}, {
  "input" : "yh like choose a specific database of files",
  "response" : "Anyway think about how we can detect changes in language use \n Yeah my idea was just having some text files as sources for extrinsic \n And for intrinsic we can use things such as word length"
}, {
  "input" : "yh ill look through the list again",
  "response" : "I'll probably look over this course or nlp over Sunday and give you some feedback on what it's about \n But it's in Python so I'll see what we can do"

  "response" : "should be fine"
}, {
  "input" : "ill be there in like 5 mins",

  "input" : "ok",
  "response" : "Heya I've done the programming for the simple plagiarism detection software but i'll be on my way to wales in a bit \n Can you make the coding a bit cleaning coz it's pretty messy \n and when i come back we do some testing and make the conclusion \n Btw Mr Holt wants us to make an exe file so when we get back, finish the fingerprinting and pick the best one to use, then combine it with the word complexity linguistic one and make it an exe file \n I'll do the conclusion and stuff whilst you do that on Thursday ð \n Oh and if possible, after you found the best fingerprinting method to use can you make it so that it compares with multiple documents ^^"

  "response" : "Can do \n A bit worried we might not finish bsd scheduler in time tho"
}, {
  "input" : "Yeah, we should defo do a lot on it \n Maybe see if we can get a group room to do it in, and all of us can spend today doing the bsd",
  "response" : "Yea can do \n Might be quite hard tho coz it's monday"
}, {
  "input" : "Yeah, true",
  "response" : "You called Viraj. \n Have u pushed your stuff \n Can we do a rebase"
}, {
  "input" : "Yeah my stuff has been pushed to master \n Yeah go ahead for a rebase, i would recommend doing it through gitlab itself",
  "response" : "Got it"
}, {
  "input" : "Cause doing it via git is a bit weird",
  "response" : "We rebased \n Somehow \n Lol \n Should we make another branch for validation or do in master?"
}, {
  "input" : "Nah do it in master \n Cause no one else is working on stuff",
  "response" : "We can't do this \n It's better to do everything in start process imo \n Input_copy refers to a const char pointer \n Which could be in the data segment stuff \n But strtok_r modifies the content within the pointer \n Which could override data and stuff"
}, {
  "input" : "No it doesn't, cause input_ is a const char and can't be modified itself \n It doesn't change anything else \n And you can't do that it start_process \n Input_copy isn't in the data segment stuff at all \n And you literally can't do it in process_start, as you need to call the thread just the executable name and not the entire input string",
  "response" : "If it cannot be modified itself \n Then why are you trying to modify it with strtok_r \n Because it modifies it \n Name doesn't matter \n It's only for debugging purposes \n Also there's not guarantee that the filename is under 16 chars"
}, {
  "input" : "Yeah and we might as well call the name the right thing, and strtok_r modifies the stack copy of the inital input string",
  "response" : "Wdym by stack copy \n At this point it's not on the stack"
}, {
  "input" : "The input string which gets strtok_r 'd in process execute and the string which gets processed in start_process are different",
  "response" : "Having it on the stack is a bad idea, what if the user passes in 4kB of command line arguments"
}, {
  "input" : "And by stack, i mean actual execution stack, not the pintos user stack or kernel stack \n They're different",
  "response" : "Yes, and you're not supposed to modify the input string"
}, {
  "input" : "Cause when it runs, when you convert from const char to char, as it can never modify the const char, it actually creates a copy of the string on the function stack which it can then use \n It never modifies the input string is what im saying",
  "response" : "What? \n No it doesn't"
}, {
  "input" : "Im pretty sure it does \n Check if the pointers are the same",
  "response" : "It's still pointing to the same piece of memory"
}, {
  "input" : "Have you checked? \n Cause im pretty sure const has protection around it \n Cause there's no point having a const arg the",
  "response" : "Sure it does, that's why it might not work \n But since it's c it wouldn't always crasg \n *crash"
}, {
  "input" : "No but in order to appease the const, when you convert it to a different type, im pretty sure it creates a copy of the string on the stack",
  "response" : "Nope"
}, {
  "input" : "That doesn't make sense \n Like at all",
  "response" : "Do you think the compiler would call strlen for you automatically"
}, {
  "input" : "? \n What are you on about",
  "response" : "Okay. Suppose you have an array on stack, modifiable. Then you pass it as a const. Then when you cast it into a chat * of course you'd be able to modify it \n How do you think the compiler would figure out how long the string is"
}, {
  "input" : "And in terms of the 4kb stack, the spec says you don't have to account for a greater than 4kb stack",
  "response" : "In order to copy it to the stack you need to know how long it is \n It says you could set a limit on theblength"
}, {
  "input" : "No it says that you can account for stacks which are greater than 4kb but you don't need to",
  "response" : "Fair \n So it's fine to have a stack overflow in that case?"
}, {
  "input" : "I guess so",
  "response" : "Okay. Fix the cast to chat * at least"
}, {
  "input" : "Again, i think it's fine, and it doesn't modify the string at all",
  "response" : "How come it doesn't modify the string?"
}, {
  "input" : "The initial input string into the function \n Cause then passing in a const char into anything is purely pointless",
  "response" : "Do you mind taking a look at how strtok_r eotks \n Why? \n You don't want strlen to modify your string \n You don't want strcpy to modify your source \n And you don't want printf to fuck up your input"
}, {
  "input" : "Ok, lets say you had a function where you pass in a string, and in order to process the string, you need to do some modifications to the string to process it, but you can't modify the input const string, then having the modifier const to the variable, but then still being able to modify it if you cast it to a non const is the worst protection in the world, cause it does nothing then \n Then there is no point to having a const modifier, cause then if you can just cast it to modify the original string, that's just like building a wall, but then just walking around it \n It's dumb",
  "response" : "It's C, not haskell"
}, {
  "input" : "Yeah ik",
  "response" : "It's not designed to stop you from intentionally doing dumb stuff"
}, {
  "input" : "Im pretty sure it is though",
  "response" : "There can't be a bulletproof design since you could always inline assembly"
}, {
  "input" : "You know what, i'll just literally change it to a quick malloc and strlcpy \n That literally can't go wrong",
  "response" : "Yep, you should do that \n And remember free it \n That was Jason \n Sorry \n Lol"
}, {
  "input" : "I'll also have a look at your code tonight so we can solve problems tomorrow \n Lmao",
  "response" : "Okok sounds good \n I'm gonna think of something to handle the exit code tonight"
}, {
  "input" : "Ok cool",
  "response" : "How is it going?"
}, {
  "input" : "We fixed the arg passing, but process exit is fucked now",
  "response" : "Ok \n I probably won't be back till like 8"
}, {
  "input" : "Ok cool, we should still be in then",
  "response" : "Ill be there in 25 mins \n If you wanna leave early you can just leave my bag in labs"
}, {
  "input" : "Nah it's cool, basically we have a really bad bug \n And we don't know why we get it, it's to do with process exit / syscalls \n Essentially, in your process exit, you just use thread_current()->process->whatever, bur for the main thread, process is null so it page faults \n But when we try and fix it, the program then just hangs \n And it doesn't even print out x",
  "response" : "I will have a look \n When I get back \n Our verify is wrong \n Verify pointers \n I'll fix it when I get back"
}, {

}, {
  "input" : "Asserting we have no locks is a bad idea",
  "response" : "It's good \n Ok viraj \n Think about this way"
}, {
  "input" : "There is a possibility we could have locks",
  "response" : "How? \n For user programs \n The lock should always be not acquired \n Yes, when you're not releasing the locks properly \n It's like deleting the page fault handler so that you don't get page faults"
}, {
  "input" : "You don't release the filesys lock if it fails to read a file \n Having a lock release in process exit means we don't have to have multiple lock releases in all the filesys calls \n I think it's much nicer, cause asserts mean that something has gone so horribly wrong in the kernel that you need to die \n It's also a lot clearer imo",
  "response" : "We only need one lock release in each system call \n If the list is empty then something has gone horribly wrong \n It's good for debugging too"
}, {
  "input" : "No, cause in some we need 2, like sys_read \n I put the lock release code back in, and i put it in thread exit, cause it makes sense there",
  "response" : "We can ask mark at labs tomorroe \n Sysread has one?"
}, {
  "input" : "Yeah that's true \n It needs 2",
  "response" : "Why? \n Just move the lock release above the if check"
}, {
  "input" : "We can change that later when we ask mark \n But yeah, we can do that \n It depends on what he has as a priority really, killing the os, or just killing the thread when something goes wrong",
  "response" : "For user programs \n You kill the thread \n For kernel programs \n You kill the os"
}, {
  "input" : "Surely instead of killing the os via an assertion faliure, we should do it more cleanly, like using kill or something \n Because i think relying on assertions to kill stuff isn't the greatest practice, cause surely you would want to print custom error messages and what not, like pintos used to do when you have a page-fault, cause assertion will just say the condition failed, but it won't say which thread caused it, or print the regsiters and what not",
  "response" : "Don't they use assert all over the place? \n And when an assert is false \n You can see where it is \n In stacktracr \n Which is like error message"
}, {
  "input" : "Yeah, but i think we want something more like the page_fault error message for that condition",
  "response" : "What do you mean? \n If a lock exits without releasing all it's locks \n You give a pagefault like error?"

When I found out that the season was ending I quickly rushed towards League and worked my ass off just trying to get back to silver. I managed to get all the way to bronze 1 with 39 league points. As I have spent a lot of my money on the game and currently am unemployed, it would be very considerate of you to  reward me with the silver rewards as I spent most my time in silver and worked very hard to get back. It will mean the world to me if you would do that and it shows that you really do care about the community.\nThank you for reading this\nYour sincerely\nNidaleeSnowBunny aka Alex \n That's what I sent to league",

  "response" : "ðð I'm trying \n Do you know how to do addition \n Do you know how to do it like this"
}, {
  "input" : "Yeah u just do it one by one \n And then add it",
  "response" : "Yea exactly \n So u multiple the 8 by 1 then 5 then 4 then 3"
}, {

}, {
  "input" : "Reverse???? \n Wait what",

}, {
  "input" : "How do u increment the power of 10",
  "response" : "Basically \n How to you make it so \n The 1 is multiplied by all the other digit? \n And then the 5 is multiplied by all the digits? \n And then the 4 and then the 3"
}, {
  "input" : "yeah but u need the result u multiply 5 by \n Like 10*that",
  "response" : "Kinda"
}, {
  "input" : "And then add it? \n Omg mul is so hard I wanna cry",
  "response" : "Focus on the 1 rn \n So you wanna multiply the one by everything right? \n Nvm take my example \n You want to multiply 8 by 1 \n Then 8 by 5 \n Then 8 by 4 then 8 by 3 \n The 1 by 5... Etc \n So how do I implement that?"
}, {
  "input" : "Hmmm?",
  "response" : "Ignore the units for now"
}, {
  "input" : "Yeah how did u do it \n What units haha",
  "response" : "You want to use 2 for loops right? \n So that every number is multiplied by the other? \n Did you use reverse for add and subtract?"
}, {
  "input" : "yeahh \n Not for add \n I mean I fixed sub",
  "response" : "It's a lot easier with reverse"
}, {
  "input" : "So now both work without reverse \n I knowwwww \n But I thought \n Idk",
  "response" : "My PPT said \n You can use it as long as you return the objects to their original state \n So if you reverse, and then remember to reverse at the end for a and b \n Then it's ok"
}, {
  "input" : "wait so u reversed it back?",
  "response" : "As long as the input arrays are not modified \n Yea"
}, {
  "input" : "U donât have to in this case right",
  "response" : "Wdym?"
}, {
  "input" : "Cos u donât need the a and b",
  "response" : "Yea but you don't want to change a and b"
}, {
  "input" : "Like u modify then within the thing but then u r not using then \n The \n Then \n Them*",
  "response" : "Are arrays primatives \n Or objects?"
}, {
  "input" : "But reversing it makes time complexly super big \n Object...? \n complexity",
  "response" : "So if you reverse it in a function \n Then u use it, without reversing it again"
}, {
  "input" : "Like the mirror thing we did for the trees thing my UTA said not use mirror or sth",
  "response" : "The number will be wrong \n Yea"
}, {
  "input" : "isnât that the same for reverse",
  "response" : "I think it's a pain if you don't reverss \n My code is already like 30 lines and I think it might be like probs 100 if you dont \n Anyways reverse is linear time?"
}, {
  "input" : "but do I have to use reverse in add and sub \n In order for mul to work",
  "response" : "They said as long as it doesn't make it a lot bigger, like to polynomial time it's ok \n No \n I didn't use add or sub in my function \n What I did was \n 1. Reverse both arrays \n 2. Initialize an output \n 3. Make length of output the maximum of the first element of a and b \n 4. Nested for loop"
}, {
  "input" : "yeah I realised it is easier to do it if u reverse it",
  "response" : "Yea \n And then you have to change the I+j-1 element"
}, {
  "input" : "wait the length is \n The same as \n Wait what",
  "response" : "Length? \n You have to change the length later on if it exceeds the initial length"
}, {
  "input" : "yeah thatâs why \n I thought u just set it to maximum \n And keep those 0 and stuff",
  "response" : "Yea u need to adjust it \n But have another go :) \n If you're still stuck ask me for help or I can send you my solution"
}, {
  "input" : "hahahha \n Iâm so lost \n Like I still donât get how u do the increment powers of 10 thing",
  "response" : "Okay so the only problem is you don't know how to increment by 10? \n Okay say you've reversed both numbers \n The first element of the output is the first element of a * first element of b mod 10 \n Then you add the quotient to the second element \n So o[1]=a[1]*b[1]mod10 \n And o[2]+=the quotient of this \n Then for o[2]+=a[1]+b[2] \n Mod 10 \n Then o[3]+= the quotient of this \n ahh i made a mistake \n lemme type this up for you \n ------------------------------- \n ----------------------------- \n ---------------------------- \n ---------------------------- \n ---------------------------- \n ---------------------------- \n ---------------------------- \n So make x1 the reverse of a and x2 the reverse of b \n and o is the output array \n you need to make it so that \n o[1]+=a[1]*b[1]mod10 \n o[2]+=the quotient of this \n then \n o[2]+=a[1]*b[2]mod10 \n o[3]+=the quotient of this \n then \n o[3]+=a[1]*b[3]mod10 \n o[4]+=the quotient of this \n until it reaches the last element of b[b[0]] \n then \n o[2]+=a[2]*b[1]mod10 \n o[3]+=the quotient of this \n o[3]+=a[2]*b[2]mod10 \n o[4]+=the quotient of this \n o[4]+=a[2]*b[3]mod10 \n ... etc \n do u see a pattern"
}, {
  "input" : "Wait lemme \n Try to \n Understand this",

  "input" : "But itâs hardddddd \n haha okok \n Thankssss \n Iâll try to understand it \n And see \n Just u donât need recursion right",

  "response" : "How are the presentations"
}, {
  "input" : "They actually cut it off when u reach 15 mins \n and the question section \n Legit like itâs only 5 mins so itâs like 2-3 questions haha",

  "input" : "right \n Yeahh I think that was too many people \n what r u guys doing now",

}, {
  "input" : "kerrykerryyy sorry I have a quick question hahahah \n u know in the paper Antonio accidentally sent us it says \n âYou are required to implement you own data structure, and you cannot therefore use built-in Java collections for these tasksâ \n and then the first question is about building a queue \n but then his solution uses Deque....? like can we do that hahaha \n Iâm so lost omg",
  "response" : "Lol I think he's just using it \n As an example \n Like for the test cases \n I think for the first question maybe u can do it like that but \n The second one u deffo have to do your own like linked list node stuff"
}, {
  "input" : "oh yeah right \n Wait is the second question basically what we did for the lab",
  "response" : "Yea basically \n But the solution I got for this paper works but when I tried to implement on the labs paper the same data structure it didn't ð"
}, {
  "input" : "wait Iâm so scared \n I donât remember anything \n This paper is so hard \n omg noooooooo my javaaaaa",
  "response" : "Actually if we got this paper and I hadn't seen it before I'd get like 10 marks"
}, {
  "input" : "yeah same \n Like i probably would only be able to do the first first question \n omg Iâm so screweeddd why did I start java so late \n And thereâs 3 hours of maths revision tomorrow morning",
  "response" : "Omg intellij tells you when there's a deadlock"
}, {
  "input" : "wait what",
  "response" : "But I do t know how to fix ._."
}, {
  "input" : "omg what is this \n java is so hard why did I think I can handle it",
  "response" : "Same for me, only start yesterday :("
}, {
  "input" : "I might actually fail java.... need to learn maths tomorrow morning too...... sigh \n I guess \n Passing would be difficult for me now \n wait whats this camera button for",

}, {
  "input" : "wow",
  "response" : "You've already passed programming anyways \n 23/24 \n 23/24"

  "input" : "no",

}, {
  "input" : "what",
  "response" : "Can't spell"
}, {
  "input" : "thats not passing programming \n java count as 42% \n :( \n im actually so screwed",
  "response" : "It's okay, if u think about it \n U still have C"

  "input" : "time to learn how to implement fine-grained list stuff again",
  "response" : "And if we work together"
}, {
  "input" : "omg hahahahaha",
  "response" : "We will get 100% in c project :p"
}, {
  "input" : "omg it would be nice if it actually happens \n ok its just easier to memorise the code now \n im just gonna \n omg \n what if those tree stuff comes up",
  "response" : "Did u do the tree past paper? \n I hope Antonio doesn't have enough time to write another past paper ._. ðð"
}, {
  "input" : "wait thereâs a tree past paper??? \n omg I canât even do this paper \n Iâm so screwed omg",
  "response" : "The one Robert helped me with ðð \n Remember??"
}, {
  "input" : "OMG hahahahaha \n that was their final interim??? \n omg I wanna die \n How do u even implement this queue",
  "response" : "Yupp, I kinda get the concurrency stuff now but I haven't looked at anything else ._."
}, {
  "input" : "omgggg",
  "response" : "I implemented like 4 threads safe queues today ._."
}, {
  "input" : "Can I see ur code..... \n I looked at Jasonâs but",
  "response" : "Yupp"
}, {
  "input" : "Itâs kind of",
  "response" : "Mine is pretty clean ð \n Gimme 2 secs"
}, {
  "input" : "Idk how to describe it \n can I seeeee \n Thank youuu",
  "response" : "I can explain if u need"
}, {
  "input" : "Wait yours is doubly linked? \n wait why do u guys all use while true",
  "response" : "Yea it makes the implementation really easy"
}, {
  "input" : "doubly linked list?",
  "response" : "Antonio used while true ðð \n Kinda, basically u have 2 null nodes \n One for the start and one of the end \n And it's optimistic locking \n You know if u want to add a node, u have to lock the last node and the second last node \n Whilst if u want to poll a node u have to lock the first and the second node"
}, {
  "input" : "Why do u need to lock the second last one \n yeah I just donât get why u need the previous node",
  "response" : "So \n Think about it \n If the second last node is not locked \n Then you can remove it right? \n And that'll be bad \n So for add node u need the one before and the one after the new node to be locked"
}, {
  "input" : "if the second last one isnât locked then u can remove it",
  "response" : "Yup whilst the add is still going on"
}, {
  "input" : "ohhh itâs because u have a tail node right \n Like itâs always there",
  "response" : "Yeah"
}, {
  "input" : "ahh icic",
  "response" : "And that makes the base case easy too"
}, {
  "input" : "Jason uses one first one and like a pointer ish thing \n So I got a bit confused",
  "response" : "Yea, he points both of them to the first node"
}, {
  "input" : "and then I donât get his while loop ahha with all the continue and stuff \n Okok lemme try understand ur code haha",
  "response" : "Lemme know if anything confuses u \n There's a few nuisances that u need to understand or else it sometimes doesn't work"
}, {
  "input" : "hahhaa thanks \n wait so \n why do we need to use while true \n So it keeps trying?",
  "response" : "Do u know what optimistic locking is"
}, {
  "input" : "ummmm I usually do up to fine grained \n ð¤¦ð»ââï¸",
  "response" : "I think optimistic is easier than fine-grain lik \n Lol"
}, {
  "input" : "wait what",
  "response" : "But basically what it is is"
}, {
  "input" : "Isnât optimistic the one that u need a flag or sth \n Check valid or sth",
  "response" : "You get the next node \n And then u lock the next node and the previous nofet \n But during the time \n When u assign the next node \n And when u lock both nodes \n The next node could've changed right"
}, {
  "input" : "u insert the new node between the two u lock right",
  "response" : "Yea"
}, {
  "input" : "Wait what the next node can be changed? Isnât it the one passed into the method call",
  "response" : "Not the new node \n The node the first node was originally pointing to \n Say a remove happened or smth \n Which is why u need to check that after the lock \n The second node is still the next of the first \n Because if it isn't then u have to start again, which is why there is while(true)"
}, {
  "input" : "but once u lock them",
  "response" : "But if it is then both nodes are locked so u can do whatever, so in this case it's adding a node"
}, {
  "input" : "Then u can ensure that the second one wonât be removed?",
  "response" : "Yea once u lock both \n But there's a time period right both u lock it \n Like when I assign secondnode to first.next"
}, {
  "input" : "then why do u need to use previous node \n Canât u",
  "response" : "There's a time when none of the nodes are locked right?"
}, {
  "input" : "yeah yeah like thereâs a time difference between the two nodes r locked \n right....?",
  "response" : "Wdym"
}, {
  "input" : "like canât u check that the second node hasnât been changed by just",
  "response" : "The time difference between when second=first.next"
}, {
  "input" : "Using next",
  "response" : "And the first node gets locked \n Nd the second node gets locked \n Basically \n The reason why it's doubly linked \n Is mainly for adding at the end of the queue \n If it wasn't doubly linked \n Then you'd have to traverse from the start each time right?"
}, {
  "input" : "yeah... \n Ohh cos Antonio does it by adding another method that finds the position \n icic \n Doubly linked then u donât have to do that? \n U just get the last one and find the first one by using previous node?",
  "response" : "Problem with doubly linked list is like deadlocks"
}, {
  "input" : "hmmm?",
  "response" : "I think like"
}, {
  "input" : "yeah cos u can traverse it both ways right....",
  "response" : "Yea \n But it's fine for queues"
}, {
  "input" : "hmmm? \n then what is it not fine for \n Omg sorry Iâm like really stupid haha",
  "response" : "Like optimistic locking? \n Basically doubly linked concurrent data structures are a pain to implement"
}, {
  "input" : "yeah thatâs what I thought \n But then \n singly linked is like \n omg I just wanna like memorise one way to do it hahaha \n but then Jasonâs way Iâm like so confused \n Antonioâs way is so long \n doubly linked Iâm worried I might implement it wrong \n Life is sad â¹ï¸",
  "response" : "I don't think they'll ask for a doubly linked one"
}, {
  "input" : "yeah but if itâs one way",
  "response" : "I can send u my singly linked list one \n If u want"
}, {
  "input" : "wait u have both?",
  "response" : "It uses finegrain"
}, {
  "input" : "yes please....?",
  "response" : "Yea I managed to just debug it"
}, {
  "input" : "that would be good enough for me now \n I think optimistic might be too hard for me ð¤¦ð»ââï¸",
  "response" : "It's kinda in the social media format ðð \n Delete and add should be similar with the two try finallys"
}, {
  "input" : "ahh this is the \n own with keys right",
  "response" : "No keys \n But it's priority \n Actually it is keys \n Lol"
}, {
  "input" : "isnât the integer \n oh \n Ok",
  "response" : "But I think it's really easy to change"
}, {
  "input" : "wait so the \n key point is \n To check if the second node \n Has been changed or not \n Right \n right.... \n like when u try to add it",
  "response" : "For the queue one \n Yesh \n But for fine grain locking"
}, {
  "input" : "is it not the same for lists",
  "response" : "U dont need to check"
}, {
  "input" : "???? Why not \n Oh cos u lock them when u traverse the lists \n ?",
  "response" : "U traverse one way \n So one operation can't over take the other"
}, {
  "input" : "hmmm \n Ok lemme just stick to \n one way \n thanks Kerryyy hope Iâm not bothering u too muchð¤¦ð»ââï¸ I feel so bad omg \n time to learn coding \n In one hour so I donât oversleep tomrorow",
  "response" : "Nono, I feel like I'm learning by explaining ð, good luck for tomorrow \n Wake me up if I can't tomorrow ._."

  "input" : "wait if itâs to do with setting C flag \n Surely tst would behave the same as and Iâm that case \n In that case*",
  "response" : "And case?"
}, {
  "input" : "like \n If itâs just to do with setting flags \n and and tst are defined to be the same \n then if and works why wouldnât tst work",
  "response" : "Lemme check and"
}, {
  "input" : "thanksss",
  "response" : "And works fine... I'm so confused"
}, {
  "input" : "waittttt \n cos if u look at the function \n setcond (updating flag) is defined to be the same for everything",

  "input" : "only for tst?",

  "input" : "??? \n howww",

  "input" : "oh wait really ahha Iâm sorry \n Like when we initialise it",

Review what you learn \n basically do this http://fdslive.oup.com/www.oup.com/oxed/secondary/maths/Alevel_C3C4.pdf?region=uk for C3 and C4 \n and message me if you need any other modules \n Step 3. Do Lots of past papers \n around 20 for each module is enough for A* \n like guarenteed A* \n You can probably get a high A if you do 3 or 4 \n basically you wanna do hard questions \n but you do some weird ass exam board, but it's kinda similar to edexcel \n so do all the Edexcel Gold Papers in C3 and C4 \n http://www.physicsandmathstutor.com/a-level-maths-papers/c3-edexcel-bronze-silver-gold/ \n Then you can do solomon papers and past papers"

But when alice started looking for kerry again, he wasn't there. \nHe wasn't on the bus.\nOr at school. She had the worst fears, of his suicide and got on the bus too find him in the place they had talked about all those times. Then she had remembered.\nThe sea.\nHis favourite place. At the next bus she was to take she realised she had lost her oyster card. She didn't have any money or directions, but she was determined to find him no matter what. She run towards the sun for it was at exactly when the sun was south of the beach that they had talked about. And that's where she saw him.\nAlice's heart skipped a beat. He stood on the rocks, waves breaking over him and was dragged into the water, a familiar voice screamed. He recognised that voice...Kerry turned around, his eyes meeting Alice's.

  "response" : "But have a look at synch.c and see how semaup and down actually works \n Then try like think of various scenarios \n E.g. if a thread is interrupted when timer_sleep is called"
}, {
  "input" : "When they said interrupt do they mean just the internal interrupts that has to be address by the CPU immediately or other threads trying to switch in  or both?",

}, {
  "input" : "Right so when a thread is interrupted when sleep is called. Thereâs instances of when it could still be THREAD_READY, and be put in the sleeping list at the same time \n As in it can switch or before itâs blocked but is still added to the list \n Switch out*",

  "input" : "Ahhh so itâs fine as long as block is before trying to add it to the list",

  "input" : "So thatâs the other struct threads yeah ?",
  "response" : "You want to block after adding to list \n How you gonna add to the list if you block the thread"
}, {
  "input" : "Oh yeah I forget that itâs based on the current running thread \n So blocking would cut off at the moment itâs called and nothing else gets executed until itâs scheduled again \n And so sema_up() would fuck it up as well cuz itâll only called when the blocked thread gets unblocked (in my code) \n So block should be the last thing in sleep \n Sleep func",

}, {
  "input" : "Its other stuff as well",
  "response" : "But Keynesians think that initially there is spare capacity and as the resources get used up, thered a bottle neck before full employment \n What else is there?"
}, {
  "input" : "Uh for countering employment",

  "input" : "For real wage unemployment neoclassisits would say to decrease market based supply side policies \n I.e. deregulate the labour market, remove trade union power etc \n So sras shifts inwards to equilibrium \n But I just dont understand which perspective says what in regard to the long rin phillips curve and the tradeoff between unemployment and inflation \n Cos you can say that there actually is no tradeoff in the long run",
  "response" : "Wdym? \n U don't actually need to say neoclassical says x \n You can just use it as a evaluative comments \n But in the long run...."
}, {
  "input" : "Hmm ok \n Can you talk about qe and crowding out?",
  "response" : "Evaluate qe with crowding out?"
}, {
  "input" : "Yh im not sure about how you explain it",
  "response" : "I'd say it's better to use it to evaluate government spending"
}, {
  "input" : "Yh for the borrowing side?",
  "response" : "Not sure because qe is where government buys assets from like banks right? \n For both"
}, {
  "input" : "Yh",
  "response" : "So basically \n If government borrows morre \n Then the demand of borrowing increases \n So the price of borrowing increases as well so private firms get crowded out"
}, {
  "input" : "Ik the chain for borrowing but wasnt sure to link qe with crowding",
  "response" : "Coz higher costs \n Oh there's another chain for borrowing \n So when they borrow \n They spend the money on factors of production right \n So the demand of land labour capital all increase \n So this also crowds out the private firms from these FOP \n Coz higher prices"
}, {
  "input" : "The gvt demands fop?",
  "response" : "How u gonna build hospitals \n Using government expenditure \n Without factors of production?"
}, {
  "input" : "But dont they use private firms",
  "response" : "True true but that means private firms can't use them \n For their own stuff \n But idk about quantitive easing \n Coz crowding out is mainly when government spending results in private firms facing higher costs"
}, {
  "input" : "Cos on econplusdal it says when qe increases, price of gvt bonds increases, so interest rate falls",
  "response" : "Oh yea \n That's the argument we had in class \n But how does that result in crowding out?"
}, {
  "input" : "Arent bonds just loanable funds? \n Government bonds",
  "response" : "Basically \n They're what governments borrow when they need moneg \n Money"
}, {
  "input" : "Maybe I'm confusing loanable funds with bonds",
  "response" : "Maybe"
}, {
  "input" : "Cos when demand for loanable funds increases (gvt borrowing) the interest rate increases \n Leading to crowding out",
  "response" : "Why does the interest increase?"
}, {
  "input" : "Gvt demands loanable funds, demand curve shifts to right, q increases and market interest rate increases \n Cos if the gvt is buying up loanable funds then less opportunity for the private sector",
  "response" : "Y does interest for the bonds decrease then for the last one?"
}, {
  "input" : "Thats why im confused",
  "response" : "Just say demand increases \n So price increases \n Price for loans \n So that's basically the interest rate \n Maybe \n It's saying the price gets increased \n And the repayments of the government bond is fixed \n So the relative yield u get back decreases \n So it's better to sell"
}, {
  "input" : "What chain is that for? \n Oh wait for crowding out, the government sells bonds not buys",
  "response" : "Crowding out is when \n I think so \n Coz they sell the bonds to raise money \n But quantities easing is when they buy back the assets"
}, {
  "input" : "So for crowding out they want more loanable funds and they give out bonds in exchange \n Basocally loanable funds is the actual money the gvt receives \n And bonds are the ious they give out",
  "response" : "Yea \n And the bonds have like an interest attached to it"
}, {
  "input" : "Ok so loanable funds and bonds are different in this context",
  "response" : "Idk I think so"
}, {
  "input" : "So for example, the banks give loanable funds to the gvt instead of to firms \n By buying up gvt bonds \n So demand for gvt bonds increases",
  "response" : "Yea"
}, {
  "input" : "Price increases and so interest rate increases so that theres an incentive to buy them (since more money would be tied up in the long run if you bought a bond)",
  "response" : "This is when government borrowing increases"
}, {
  "input" : "Yh \n Cos thats when they sell off bonds",
  "response" : "Wait I'm confused \n Which argument is this for"
}, {
  "input" : "Crowding out",
  "response" : "Okay this follow this \n If government borrowing increases, the demand for borrowing will also increase \n This causes an increase in price and hence interest rates \n Which means private firms face higher costs and are thereby crowded out"
}, {
  "input" : "ð \n Ok it makes sense cos qe is the opposite \n Since they are buying back bonds and giving out cash",
  "response" : "Yea"
}, {
  "input" : "And demand for bonds increases, price increases, bond yield falls",
  "response" : "ð"
}, {
  "input" : "ð \n Do you know if theres a word for the point at which it becomes more efficient to invest in capital machinery and technology in a firm over workers?",

  "response" : "Ah i said immigration for the firms"

  "response" : "Did you do computing a level"
}, {
  "input" : "They had a problem sheet with a few questions, asked me to look at some I found interesting and discuss how I'd approach them \n No I didn't \n Maths and further maths more important \n Especially further",

  "response" : "Ah"
}, {
  "input" : "All other interviews were fine because i had a strong maths background \n Also decision maths is helpful \n I didn't do it but I learnt a bit myself beforehand",
  "response" : "Our school doesn't offer ð¢ \n Oh ok"
}, {
  "input" : "It's ok it's pretty easy \n I'd have a quick look beforehand \n And definitely go over induction if you've done that \n From further",

}, {

  "input" : "I really liked it",
  "response" : "That's good \n Hopefully I can get in ð"
}, {
  "input" : "Like it's a lot of work but I think it's worth it, and most people generally really are glad they went here. Though there is a really unusually high drop out rate in the first year, but that's actually good because if you don't like it and it's not for you, you'll know that within the first month. And you'll just switch to another subject. I have a few friends who did that and changed to physics or biomed, and are happy with that. \n I'm sure you'll be fine if you go to tiffin, they have probs prepared you well :p",

}, {
  "input" : "yeah im guessing so",

}, {
  "input" : "(soz if im wrong)",
  "response" : "dw, so when u add it together \n is it just one function \n or 2"
}, {
  "input" : "hold up",

}, {
  "input" : "oh my i dont even get it",

  "input" : "weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeE \n holup \n so think the mapping is from a function to a definite integral where arbitary constants a and b are inputted \n so like to prove its linear \n you have to prove like \n but we already know it is",
  "response" : "yea i know how to prove this \n but i don't get the notation"
}, {
  "input" : "which part is confuzzle",
  "response" : "what parameter \n do u put into o \n function \n is it o[x1,x2]"

  "input" : "any function \n so like u literally input the function",
  "response" : "so like o[2x+5]"
}, {
  "input" : "yeahh",
  "response" : "where do u get the b and a from then"
}, {
  "input" : "it doesnt matter \n cuz like basically every function u pick must be integratable when limits are arbitary constants a and b \n so like as long as a and b stay the same for for f and g \n you should be able to show that mapping is linear \n i feel like explanation is poor",
  "response" : "So like this"

  "input" : "or do u just do like newtree = tree \n on each node",
  "response" : "Hmm kinda? \n U can't just create a new instance like"

}, {
  "input" : "mm is........ \n i havent really started.... \n :| still reading notes",

  "input" : "we deadddd \n lmk if u wan 5b btww",
  "response" : "Ok I'm trying another way \n Did u look at Q4 \n Could we do it like that?"

  "input" : "hmmm not suree \n thats the palindrome one right?? \n there might be a similar way??",

}, {
  "input" : "oh right i mean \n u can just replace guess x y with like a \n by writing a = guess x y but \n if that's what u mean :o",
  "response" : "I mean like write it in that style instead of like forall \n But I don't think u can"
}, {
  "input" : "naaa cuz that question is not list \n but 5b uses lists where u need to checck every elementtt \n i'll just say really breifly but i just compared input list with output list \n to check if they equal \n but there are like different cases for the actualy input number",
  "response" : "Can I not do this?"
}, {
  "input" : "im actually not certain but i dont tihnk we can.. \n like not sure if we're allowed to use the cons",

}, {
  "input" : "dont think so :o \n i havent seen it done on the ppt",
  "response" : "What did you do for 1a?"

  "input" : "*powerpoint \n I'll just send u 5ab for ref but \n oh i forgot to write that they're nat",

}, {
  "input" : "i mean its not wrong if we're allowed to use consss",
  "response" : "I think u can use : and ++"
}, {
  "input" : "omgggg yeah then u fine i thinkk \n damn that would have made some stuff easier ._.",
  "response" : "Is this ok \n For part b \n Nvm \n Not for part b \n I think that was for part c lol \n Omg"
}, {
  "input" : "HAHA",
  "response" : "I thought I was doing part b... \n Yours was quicker too \n Argh"
}, {
  "input" : "aaa dw about it ._. \n only thing is im not sure u can write xs!!m =  guess2 xs :c \n in the where clause \n instead u can just write \" AND (xs!!m = guess2 xs)\" \n inside the thereexists m clause",
  "response" : "Oh fairs \n Yea that's true \n Thanks"

  "input" : "npp ð",

}, {
  "input" : "i gave up :( \n (for now \n u did guess5 too right?",
  "response" : "Not yet \n Have you? \n I think I got guess 5"
}, {
  "input" : "naa I did everything upto guess5",
  "response" : "Isn't 4 and 5 the same?"
}, {
  "input" : "5 I just a helper function but \n idk isn't the post conditions different",
  "response" : "Wdym? It's just the helper function \n What is the pre condition for 4? \n It's part of one question d"

  "input" : "so we don't need to do a separate post condition for guess5? \n ooooo \n my that's nice",
  "response" : "Lemme copy my answers"

  "input" : "yeetus",
  "response" : "Like this?"
}, {
  "input" : "omfg ure big brained \n + is concat right?",

  "input" : "AAAAA BUTTT \n woops the list gets flipped :|",
  "response" : "Oh shiz"
}, {
  "input" : ":c",
  "response" : "I think it's n-m \n Or Smth for the second one \n Nvm it should be fine \n Because for helleh \n It's indexed 012345 \n It compares 0 with 5 \n 1 with 4 and 2 with 3"

  "input" : "wut",

  "input" : "but 321 + 21 = 32121 \n which is not a palindrome \n u get me \n or am i tripping.png",
  "response" : "It's only characters? \n The input \n ?"
}, {
  "input" : "err yeah i tihnk",
  "response" : "And it returns a Boolean"
}, {
  "input" : "uhuh \n so the post condition must always return true if the output is correct \n but the post condition you wrote will return true for 321 23 right?",
  "response" : "The post condition returns true if the input is a palindrome? \n Yea"
}, {
  "input" : "but for guess5 that will return false",
  "response" : "Y?"
}, {
  "input" : "because it will continue recursing and do\ng5 21 323 \n then\ng5 1 2323",
  "response" : "Oh I kinda get it"
}, {
  "input" : "then \ng5 [] 12323 \n and return false \n aaaa so hard to explain on text sory",

  "input" : "Hi! My name is Seiya, and Iâm a first year currently studying computing. Having been to the majority of events this year, ABACUS has become a core part of my first year at Imperial. It has been a source of many of my best memories here and has given me countless opportunities to find many new friendships as well as my best ones. To give back to the society, I am running to be the Treasurer of IC ABACUS for the following year.\n\nI have always found curiosity in how the society is able to consistently bring amazing events whilst always maintaining reasonable prices, and it would be my pleasure to be able to both understand and control the financial side of ABACUS efficiently. Having had taken courses concerning financial knowledge in the past, I believe I can contribute well as the treasurer of ABACUS. I am also confident in my abilities to proficiently use and adapt to any system that the society may currently employ to manage finances with my long term experience with relevant software.\n\nOne of my main focuses for the next year will be to increase the budget both via an effective allocation of subsidies as well as via aiming to obtain the Union grant. This will enable us to make more events and each one more accessible. Thank you for your consideration and I hope to be able to contribute to improving the subsidies and experiences that the members will find in ABACUS next year. \n im so done \n fff \n i wanna die",
  "response" : "Woah yours is so thicc \n Hi, Iâm Kerry and I am a first year running for IC ABACUS Vice President. This year, ABACUS has offered a fantastic range of social experience for us to enjoy and the community has a huge impact on my first year at Imperial. The social events have given me the opportunities to make fond memories and friends with a diverse range of people, some of whom are my closest friends.  I want to give back and play an active role in helping next yearâs members to experience what ABACUS has been for me.\n\nI am approachable and friendly. I was in charge of a class of 30 secondary school students during the production of a form music video and this helped me gain valuable organisational experience and leadership skills.\n\nHaving been to almost all the events and enjoying them thoroughly, I am in a position to help further improve some of these events making them bigger and better next year. In the last year ABACUS has grown by over 75%, one of my aims will be to adapt to this by securing more tickets for external events and organising internal events which can accommodate for more members. \n fuuuu I have 50 words to fill and yours sounds so much more sophisticated than mine xD"

}, {
  "input" : "so the thread is just referenced via the semaphore? \n this part I understand \n but I just feel like just putting in the thread instead of the semaphore \n and doing thread block unblock directly is just...strictly more efficient \n but I guess if the spec says prefer to use semaphore... \n wrapper in timer.h or c?",

  "input" : "also \n are u sure u initialize the semaphore just before u block it; \n this means that it'll get initialized multiple times \n (redundant)",

}, {
  "input" : "wait... \n so the moment \n sema down is called \n the thread stops on that exact line? \n correct? \n so sw cant be overwritteb \n until the thread is unblocked \n omg \n I get u now \n thanks kerry",
  "response" : "Ye \n Nws"

  "input" : "okk",

  "input" : "what \n I thought u said lock shouldn't be used",
  "response" : "Because u want same thread to lock and unlock the list \n I mean u cant \n But if you want to guarantee exclusive access of a resource you need to use lock \n I think it's something like if the list is locked \n Like when you're changing priority \n Then an interrupt happens"

  "input" : "ð \n okk \n cool beans \n did u just use 4 \n or did use macro time slice \n cuz time slice is in thread.c",

  "input" : "I think jimin did yee",

  "input" : "do wE HAVE to do the second method?",

}, {
  "input" : "why cant we use the 1st method \n I Wanna diee",
  "response" : "You can \n But u have to change page fault anyways"
}, {
  "input" : "ooo",
  "response" : "Basically \n When you do something like \n Msg(â%dâ,*(int *)NULL) \n Itâs gonna try to dereference NULL before"

  "input" : "mhm",

  "response" : "and when os tries to dereference \n it will page fault"
}, {
  "input" : "so in the page fault \n I have to exit?? \n with -1",

}, {
  "input" : "which line should it go in",

  "input" : "the fuckk \n is that legal hahahahaha",
  "response" : "Yea \n Itâs whatâs meant to happen \n Mark said on piazza \n Because when a page fault happens \n You only need to kill the current thread \n And not the whole os"
}, {
  "input" : "is this something they recently posted",
  "response" : "Kinda"
}, {
  "input" : "oo \n found it \n thanks \n I will try now",

  "input" : "so sad \n tyty u2 \n just to clarify \n when u exec \n u semadown on your own execsema \n and expect the child to sema up \n on it? \n also the reason why it is safe to ask if parent process is null is because malloc is used so it wont page fault? \n and the exec sema is in process struct in thread?",
