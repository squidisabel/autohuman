He felt he had wasted his entire life, that he was going to be forever alone. Alice felt that she should have realised that kerry was the only one for her. She too cried, she had wanted him so much. But when alice started looking for kerry again, he wasn't there. \nHe wasn't on the bus.\nOr at school. She had the worst fears, of his suicide and got on the bus too find him in the place they had talked about all those times. Then she had remembered.\nThe sea.\nHis favourite place. At the next bus she was to take she realised she had lost her oyster card. She didn't have any money or directions, but she was determined to find him no matter what. She run towards the sun for it was at exactly when the sun was south of the beach that they had talked about. And that's where she saw him.\nAlice's heart skipped a beat. He stood on the rocks, waves breaking over him and was dragged into the water, a familiar voice screamed. He recognised that voice...Kerry turned around, his eyes meeting Alice's. He recognised that voice...Kerry turned around, his eyes meeting Alice's. They embraced and held each other under the sunset, never to let go. \n http://www.tropicalstormrisk.com/tracker/dynamic/201810W.html \n è­¦å¯å± \n è±è²è­¦å¯å±"

}, {
  "input" : "what's the actual method that copies it",
  "response" : "U use a recursive thing which copies each node"

  "input" : "or do u just do like newtree = tree \n on each node",
  "response" : "Hmm kinda? \n U can't just create a new instance like"

  "input" : "IKR",
  "response" : "But how do I write the post shit \n Legit spent 2 hours on this already...."
}, {
  "input" : "for the one's where the output is nat \n u can just use a where clause",
  "response" : "Wut!?"
}, {
  "input" : "i'll show u hold on",

}, {
  "input" : "did that make sense?? \n skip 5b btw that stuff is nasty....",
  "response" : "Hmm I think so \n ... I was stuck on 5b"
}, {
  "input" : "i havent finished the last question for logic yett \n yeah deadass that stuff is like x50 harder than other questions \n so stupid \n i think i finally got a solution that overs all cases for 5b",

}, {
  "input" : "mm is........ \n i havent really started.... \n :| still reading notes",
  "response" : "Same lol \n Rip"
}, {
  "input" : "we deadddd \n lmk if u wan 5b btww",
  "response" : "Ok I'm trying another way \n Did u look at Q4 \n Could we do it like that?"
}, {
  "input" : "hmmm not suree \n thats the palindrome one right?? \n there might be a similar way??",
  "response" : "Wait what? \n Guess?"
}, {
  "input" : "guess4",
  "response" : "I meant question 4 \n On the logic sheet \n Not pmt"
}, {
  "input" : "OHHH i didnt...do that.. \n :|",
  "response" : "But look at the post syntax"
}, {
  "input" : "oh right i mean \n u can just replace guess x y with like a \n by writing a = guess x y but \n if that's what u mean :o",
  "response" : "I mean like write it in that style instead of like forall \n But I don't think u can"
}, {
  "input" : "naaa cuz that question is not list \n but 5b uses lists where u need to checck every elementtt \n i'll just say really breifly but i just compared input list with output list \n to check if they equal \n but there are like different cases for the actualy input number",
  "response" : "Can I not do this?"
}, {
  "input" : "im actually not certain but i dont tihnk we can.. \n like not sure if we're allowed to use the cons",
  "response" : "Wait we can't use cons?"
}, {
  "input" : "dont think so :o \n i havent seen it done on the ppt",
  "response" : "What did you do for 1a?"
}, {
  "input" : "*powerpoint \n I'll just send u 5ab for ref but \n oh i forgot to write that they're nat",
  "response" : "Nvm mines wrong \n Thanks tho"
}, {
  "input" : "i mean its not wrong if we're allowed to use consss",
  "response" : "I think u can use : and ++"
}, {
  "input" : "omgggg yeah then u fine i thinkk \n damn that would have made some stuff easier ._.",
  "response" : "Is this ok \n For part b \n Nvm \n Not for part b \n I think that was for part c lol \n Omg"
}, {
  "input" : "HAHA",
  "response" : "I thought I was doing part b... \n Yours was quicker too \n Argh"
}, {
  "input" : "aaa dw about it ._. \n only thing is im not sure u can write xs!!m =  guess2 xs :c \n in the where clause \n instead u can just write \" AND (xs!!m = guess2 xs)\" \n inside the thereexists m clause",
  "response" : "Oh fairs \n Yea that's true \n Thanks"
}, {
  "input" : "npp ð",
  "response" : "Have u finished logic \n Omg finally on Q5 \n 4"
}, {
  "input" : "i gave up :( \n (for now \n u did guess5 too right?",
  "response" : "Not yet \n Have you? \n I think I got guess 5"
}, {
  "input" : "naa I did everything upto guess5",
  "response" : "Isn't 4 and 5 the same?"
}, {
  "input" : "5 I just a helper function but \n idk isn't the post conditions different",
  "response" : "Wdym? It's just the helper function \n What is the pre condition for 4? \n It's part of one question d"
}, {
  "input" : "so we don't need to do a separate post condition for guess5? \n ooooo \n my that's nice",
  "response" : "Lemme copy my answers"
}, {
  "input" : "yeetus",
  "response" : "Like this?"
}, {
  "input" : "omfg ure big brained \n + is concat right?",
  "response" : "Yea \n Opps \n Ment to have ++"
}, {
  "input" : "AAAAA BUTTT \n woops the list gets flipped :|",
  "response" : "Oh shiz"
}, {
  "input" : ":c",
  "response" : "I think it's n-m \n Or Smth for the second one \n Nvm it should be fine \n Because for helleh \n It's indexed 012345 \n It compares 0 with 5 \n 1 with 4 and 2 with 3"
}, {
  "input" : "yeah but after each recursive call on guess5 \n what it does it it takes first letter of as \n so like helleh \n elleh h \n elleh eh \n as++bs is elleheh",
  "response" : "It doesn't recurse"
}, {
  "input" : "wut",
  "response" : "It just adds the two arguments \n And checks if it's a palidrome \n E.g. hel leh becomes helleh"
}, {
  "input" : "are u talking about your post condition or the haskell function guess5?",
  "response" : "My post"
}, {
  "input" : "cuz the haskell function written in the thing doesnt do that",
  "response" : "What does it do?"
}, {
  "input" : "it will say yes if as=hel, bs=hel \n for sake of clarity lets say input is 12321",
  "response" : "Ok"
}, {
  "input" : "and g5=gues5",
  "response" : "Ok"
}, {
  "input" : "first recursive call will be g5 2321 1",
  "response" : "Yea"
}, {
  "input" : "second call will be 321 21 \n then it will return true",
  "response" : "Yea"
}, {
  "input" : "but 321 + 21 = 32121 \n which is not a palindrome \n u get me \n or am i tripping.png",
  "response" : "It's only characters? \n The input \n ?"
}, {
  "input" : "err yeah i tihnk",
  "response" : "And it returns a Boolean"
}, {
  "input" : "uhuh \n so the post condition must always return true if the output is correct \n but the post condition you wrote will return true for 321 23 right?",
  "response" : "The post condition returns true if the input is a palindrome? \n Yea"
}, {
  "input" : "but for guess5 that will return false",
  "response" : "Y?"
}, {
  "input" : "because it will continue recursing and do\ng5 21 323 \n then\ng5 1 2323",
  "response" : "Oh I kinda get it"
}, {
  "input" : "then \ng5 [] 12323 \n and return false \n aaaa so hard to explain on text sory",
  "response" : "I understand \n I give up :s"

  "input" : "Hi! My name is Seiya, and Iâm a first year currently studying computing. Having been to the majority of events this year, ABACUS has become a core part of my first year at Imperial. It has been a source of many of my best memories here and has given me countless opportunities to find many new friendships as well as my best ones. To give back to the society, I am running to be the Treasurer of IC ABACUS for the following year.\n\nI have always found curiosity in how the society is able to consistently bring amazing events whilst always maintaining reasonable prices, and it would be my pleasure to be able to both understand and control the financial side of ABACUS efficiently. Having had taken courses concerning financial knowledge in the past, I believe I can contribute well as the treasurer of ABACUS. I am also confident in my abilities to proficiently use and adapt to any system that the society may currently employ to manage finances with my long term experience with relevant software.\n\nOne of my main focuses for the next year will be to increase the budget both via an effective allocation of subsidies as well as via aiming to obtain the Union grant. This will enable us to make more events and each one more accessible. Thank you for your consideration and I hope to be able to contribute to improving the subsidies and experiences that the members will find in ABACUS next year. \n im so done \n fff \n i wanna die",
  "response" : "Woah yours is so thicc \n Hi, Iâm Kerry and I am a first year running for IC ABACUS Vice President. This year, ABACUS has offered a fantastic range of social experience for us to enjoy and the community has a huge impact on my first year at Imperial. The social events have given me the opportunities to make fond memories and friends with a diverse range of people, some of whom are my closest friends.  I want to give back and play an active role in helping next yearâs members to experience what ABACUS has been for me.\n\nI am approachable and friendly. I was in charge of a class of 30 secondary school students during the production of a form music video and this helped me gain valuable organisational experience and leadership skills.\n\nHaving been to almost all the events and enjoying them thoroughly, I am in a position to help further improve some of these events making them bigger and better next year. In the last year ABACUS has grown by over 75%, one of my aims will be to adapt to this by securing more tickets for external events and organising internal events which can accommodate for more members. \n fuuuu I have 50 words to fill and yours sounds so much more sophisticated than mine xD"

}, {
  "input" : "yeah i get what u mean",
  "response" : "I don't think chandlers is that comedic \n other than maybe the first part \n which is like goofy which kinda portrays his personality"

}, {
  "input" : "its harddd",

}, {
  "input" : "lets get some inspiration",
  "response" : "like more about leadership skills \n can't I put something like \n I was in charge of a class of 30 secondary school students during the production of a form music video and this helped me gain valuable organisational experience and leadership skills. I believe that I am suited for this role with my organisational and leadership skills. \n oops \n grammar is wrong"
}, {
  "input" : "kek i can see the resemblence to lizzie's",
  "response" : "nvm \n ye \n fffffff \n I wanna die \n I think the first part"
}, {
  "input" : "i mean its finee",
  "response" : "is like similar to lizzie \n jings \n and aislings \n and chandlers"
}, {
  "input" : "then its fine",
  "response" : "but like middle bit"
}, {
  "input" : "if everyone's was somewhat similar it means its a working stratergy \n i would try to be less specific about your leadership thing",
  "response" : "is too similar to lizzie \n and end bit is fine I think"
}, {
  "input" : "you can be a bit more vague",
  "response" : "wdym>"
}, {
  "input" : "like u dont need to say 30",
  "response" : "and I can get rid of music"
}, {
  "input" : "i think \n music is fine \n you can just say like i was in charge of production of a form music video back in highschool? \n or smth like that",
  "response" : "I feel like its good to show that like \n it's explicitly a class \n nvm"
}, {
  "input" : "mm i guess you could if u want \n thats up2u \n sorry i hope youre not offended by any of this",
  "response" : "haha no no \n it's good \n thx <3 \n I want to make it better xD"
}, {
  "input" : "ahaha okk another grill then",
  "response" : "yay \n keep grilling till I'm burnt pls"
}, {
  "input" : "likee lizzie just said \"Through a leading role in my local youth group\" \n which although is vague its like enough to show what she needs to portray? \n which is just the fact that she has exp \n i would try to use the word \"lead\" instead of in charge also since it has a more clear impact imo",
  "response" : "yea you're right"
}, {
  "input" : "dont be too scared to mimic other people'stings as long as its not identical \n i tihnk its inevitable that itll be somewht simialr",
  "response" : "Hi, Iâm Kerry and I am a first year running for IC ABACUS Vice President. This year, ABACUS has offered a fantastic range of social experience for us to enjoy and the community has a huge impact on my first year at Imperial. The social events have given me the opportunities to make fond memories and friends with different types of people, some of whom are my closest friends.  I want to give back and play an active role in helping next yearâs members to experience what ABACUS has been for me.\n\nI lead production of a form video which has helped me gain organisational experience and leadership skills.\n\nHaving been to almost all the events and enjoying them thoroughly, I can help further improve some of these events making them bigger and better next year. In the last year ABACUS has grown by over 75%, one of my aims will be to adapt to this by securing more tickets for external events and organising internal events which can accommodate for more members. I hope to expose more of ABACUS's cultural promotion side in hopes to obtain Union grants. \n okay this is what is it now \n I kinda wanna change the end \n I just copied and pasted for now"
}, {
  "input" : "i would say \"many different types of ppl\" \n sorry im not even sure if its getting strictly betterr \n also yeah now i see what you meant about wanting to show that the music video was a class thing",
  "response" : "idk tho \n like it reads simpler here \n and I can go into detail in agm"
}, {
  "input" : "that is deffo an approach \n but u wanna sell your leading of production here \n if thats your main exp as a leader \n soz u were right it will be nice to integrate the faact that you lead a decently sized roup \n group",
  "response" : "but class kinda implies \n like 30 students"
}, {
  "input" : "m \n maybe you can try structure it like chandlers??",
  "response" : "his structure is intro \n experiences \n focus"
}, {
  "input" : "\"having had expeirence  leading a form in a high school projuect\" etc etc",
  "response" : "conclusion"
}, {
  "input" : "hm?",
  "response" : "Having had experience of leading the production of a form video, I have developed leadership skills and organisational experienceâ¦ \n I think it looks better"
}, {
  "input" : "mm i would agree \n but i would put music video \n instead of just video",
  "response" : "y?"
}, {
  "input" : "i think it makes it sound more impressive \n video is too vague and can be anything triival as well as impressive",
  "response" : "fair fair"
}, {
  "input" : "if it was like film or play or movie then fair but",
  "response" : "Having had experience of leading the production of a form music video, I have developed leadership skills and organisational experience which will be necessary for this role. \n vital instead of necessary"
}, {
  "input" : "mm both have pros and cons imo \n vital sounds more tryhard but fits better in this context \n necessary is less formal",
  "response" : "ye \n or we have required \n lmao \n y is English so complex \n ._."
}, {
  "input" : "the thing is its not required or strictly necessary \n its just beneficial \n you can still do a good job without any exp right",
  "response" : "it said something in the post"
}, {
  "input" : "you must have some exp?",
  "response" : "no \n must be highly organised... \n but like how do you even show that you are highly organised"
}, {
  "input" : "that...is true \n its hard \n but i just feel like saying \"im organized\" sounds baseless and hard to justify?",
  "response" : "exactly!"
}, {
  "input" : "but i guess if thats the only realisitc option",
  "response" : "like how the others do it is like \n ... \n I assure you that I'm highly organized"
}, {
  "input" : "lizzie did that tho right?",
  "response" : "like nani"
}, {
  "input" : "ahahaha \n yeah...",
  "response" : "but like \n I kinda need to be organised to lead the production \n so it kinda implies I'm highly organised"
}, {
  "input" : "mm you could be a little more explicit conerning that then? \n although it's not easy",
  "response" : "Having had experience of leading the production of a form music video, I have developed leadership skills which will be vital for this role and I had to be highly organized in order to finish the project before the deadline."
}, {
  "input" : "mmm it sounds a bit forced but i think its fine? \n since im not too sure if there are that many better solutions.. \n sorry kerry im gonna pass out soon im tired afff",

}, {

}, {
  "input" : "wait can u show me your code \n so interrupts aren't blocked in timer_sleep? \n wait when do u check \n they need to be unblocked \n if they need to be",

}, {
  "input" : "elaborate",
  "response" : "Theyâre blocked when list insert is c allied to prevent race conditions \n Is called*"
}, {
  "input" : "I KNEW IT \n so semaphore is pointless \n ?",
  "response" : "I mean \n Meant \n You need to disable interrupts \n Sorry \n WHen list insert is called u need to disable interrupts \n Semadown calls thread_block \n And semaup calls thread_unblock"
}, {
  "input" : "it's just a waste",
  "response" : "But itâs like a higher level of abstraction"
}, {
  "input" : "to make them do that \n it only makes sense \n when u dont disable interrupts",
  "response" : "Wdym"
}, {
  "input" : "sema just makes it do the interrupts for you and block the threads \n if u need to block interrupts anyways",

}, {
  "input" : "I feel like it's trying too hard to not go low level",
  "response" : "- Issa"
}, {
  "input" : "like \n u dont need that level of abstraction \n in this context \n well..I think so anyways",
  "response" : "Apparently according to James it makes future parts easier"
}, {
  "input" : "it's just a matter of it we can justify it well enough \n james..?",
  "response" : "Jmc James"
}, {
  "input" : "wut... \n did Chandler say the same thing?",
  "response" : "Chandler said to itâs all about abstraction \n Itâs better to abstract the sleeping part of the thread out of the thread struct"
}, {
  "input" : "why use a sleep wrapper instead of putting it in struct thread? \n also what does sleep wrapper contain",
  "response" : "If a thread doesnât sleep, then those elements are required to be in the stack \n Arenât \n Sleeper wrapper contains list elem, to be placed in the list, the semaphore and the wake up time"
}, {
  "input" : "so the thread is just referenced via the semaphore? \n this part I understand \n but I just feel like just putting in the thread instead of the semaphore \n and doing thread block unblock directly is just...strictly more efficient \n but I guess if the spec says prefer to use semaphore... \n wrapper in timer.h or c?",
  "response" : "I ended up putting it in thread.h, because there were some insertions in thread.h in the faq"
}, {
  "input" : "wtf...? \n wait how does that make any sense \n its only used in timer",
  "response" : "Idk, it's somehow related to threads I guess \n It's one wrapper per thread"
}, {
  "input" : "I think ure trying too hard to adjust to that \n I'm pretty sure they just stored stuff in the thread struct \n that's how ppl did it in sample codes online too",
  "response" : "Maybe, it's up to u with how u do it"
}, {
  "input" : "also \n are u sure u initialize the semaphore just before u block it; \n this means that it'll get initialized multiple times \n (redundant)",
  "response" : "It only gets initialised when a thread is out to sleep \n But it means that if a thread isnât out to sleep then there is no need to initialise a semaphore"
}, {
  "input" : "but gets reinitialized every time it sleeps?",
  "response" : "Yea"
}, {
  "input" : "can u init twice without any consequences?",
  "response" : "But stack space on average will be less \n Will be more than if it was in the thread struct"
}, {
  "input" : "would it not memory leak?",
  "response" : "Why would it memory leak"
}, {
  "input" : "wait... \n so the moment \n sema down is called \n the thread stops on that exact line? \n correct? \n so sw cant be overwritteb \n until the thread is unblocked \n omg \n I get u now \n thanks kerry",
  "response" : "Ye \n Nws"
}, {
  "input" : "that's kinda big brain",
  "response" : "Just implement what u think is best"
}, {
  "input" : "still think thread unblock is better... \n but if the spec says prefer semas",
  "response" : "Just do that then"
}, {
  "input" : "I want points tho so...",

}, {
  "input" : "isnt that the whole point of a semaphore",

  "input" : "sema_down\nmodify readylist[i]\nsema_up \n this makes it so interrupts are not disabled \n and it wont block other threads if they will not be modifying the same ready list \n only stops other threads from modifying or accessing the same list at the same time \n wait why can a lock not be used to avoid the race",
  "response" : "I think there's no effective way of doing it \n Without it being over complicated"
}, {
  "input" : "wut",
  "response" : "I need to think about it"
}, {
  "input" : "okk",
  "response" : "Anyways u shouldn't use semaphore, lock is better"

  "input" : "what \n I thought u said lock shouldn't be used",
  "response" : "Because u want same thread to lock and unlock the list \n I mean u cant \n But if you want to guarantee exclusive access of a resource you need to use lock \n I think it's something like if the list is locked \n Like when you're changing priority \n Then an interrupt happens"

  "response" : "ðð I'm trying \n Do you know how to do addition \n Do you know how to do it like this"
}, {
  "input" : "Yeah u just do it one by one \n And then add it",
  "response" : "Yea exactly \n So u multiple the 8 by 1 then 5 then 4 then 3"

}, {
  "input" : "Reverse???? \n Wait what",

  "input" : "How do u increment the power of 10",

}, {
  "input" : "yeah but u need the result u multiply 5 by \n Like 10*that",
  "response" : "Kinda"
}, {
  "input" : "And then add it? \n Omg mul is so hard I wanna cry",
  "response" : "Focus on the 1 rn \n So you wanna multiply the one by everything right? \n Nvm take my example \n You want to multiply 8 by 1 \n Then 8 by 5 \n Then 8 by 4 then 8 by 3 \n The 1 by 5... Etc \n So how do I implement that?"
}, {
  "input" : "Hmmm?",
  "response" : "Ignore the units for now"
}, {
  "input" : "Yeah how did u do it \n What units haha",
  "response" : "You want to use 2 for loops right? \n So that every number is multiplied by the other? \n Did you use reverse for add and subtract?"
}, {
  "input" : "yeahh \n Not for add \n I mean I fixed sub",
  "response" : "It's a lot easier with reverse"
}, {
  "input" : "So now both work without reverse \n I knowwwww \n But I thought \n Idk",
  "response" : "My PPT said \n You can use it as long as you return the objects to their original state \n So if you reverse, and then remember to reverse at the end for a and b \n Then it's ok"
}, {
  "input" : "wait so u reversed it back?",
  "response" : "As long as the input arrays are not modified \n Yea"
}, {
  "input" : "U donât have to in this case right",
  "response" : "Wdym?"
}, {
  "input" : "Cos u donât need the a and b",
  "response" : "Yea but you don't want to change a and b"
}, {
  "input" : "Like u modify then within the thing but then u r not using then \n The \n Then \n Them*",
  "response" : "Are arrays primatives \n Or objects?"

  "input" : "But reversing it makes time complexly super big \n Object...? \n complexity",
  "response" : "So if you reverse it in a function \n Then u use it, without reversing it again"
}, {
  "input" : "Like the mirror thing we did for the trees thing my UTA said not use mirror or sth",
  "response" : "The number will be wrong \n Yea"
}, {
  "input" : "isnât that the same for reverse",
  "response" : "I think it's a pain if you don't reverss \n My code is already like 30 lines and I think it might be like probs 100 if you dont \n Anyways reverse is linear time?"
}, {
  "input" : "but do I have to use reverse in add and sub \n In order for mul to work",
  "response" : "They said as long as it doesn't make it a lot bigger, like to polynomial time it's ok \n No \n I didn't use add or sub in my function \n What I did was \n 1. Reverse both arrays \n 2. Initialize an output \n 3. Make length of output the maximum of the first element of a and b \n 4. Nested for loop"
}, {
  "input" : "yeah I realised it is easier to do it if u reverse it",
  "response" : "Yea \n And then you have to change the I+j-1 element"
}, {
  "input" : "wait the length is \n The same as \n Wait what",
  "response" : "Length? \n You have to change the length later on if it exceeds the initial length"
}, {
  "input" : "yeah thatâs why \n I thought u just set it to maximum \n And keep those 0 and stuff",
  "response" : "Yea u need to adjust it \n But have another go :) \n If you're still stuck ask me for help or I can send you my solution"
}, {
  "input" : "hahahha \n Iâm so lost \n Like I still donât get how u do the increment powers of 10 thing",
  "response" : "Okay so the only problem is you don't know how to increment by 10? \n Okay say you've reversed both numbers \n The first element of the output is the first element of a * first element of b mod 10 \n Then you add the quotient to the second element \n So o[1]=a[1]*b[1]mod10 \n And o[2]+=the quotient of this \n Then for o[2]+=a[1]+b[2] \n Mod 10 \n Then o[3]+= the quotient of this \n ahh i made a mistake \n lemme type this up for you \n ------------------------------- \n ----------------------------- \n ---------------------------- \n ---------------------------- \n ---------------------------- \n ---------------------------- \n ---------------------------- \n So make x1 the reverse of a and x2 the reverse of b \n and o is the output array \n you need to make it so that \n o[1]+=a[1]*b[1]mod10 \n o[2]+=the quotient of this \n then \n o[2]+=a[1]*b[2]mod10 \n o[3]+=the quotient of this \n then \n o[3]+=a[1]*b[3]mod10 \n o[4]+=the quotient of this \n until it reaches the last element of b[b[0]] \n then \n o[2]+=a[2]*b[1]mod10 \n o[3]+=the quotient of this \n o[3]+=a[2]*b[2]mod10 \n o[4]+=the quotient of this \n o[4]+=a[2]*b[3]mod10 \n ... etc \n do u see a pattern"
}, {
  "input" : "Wait lemme \n Try to \n Understand this",

  "response" : "How are the presentations"
}, {
  "input" : "They actually cut it off when u reach 15 mins \n and the question section \n Legit like itâs only 5 mins so itâs like 2-3 questions haha",

  "input" : "right \n Yeahh I think that was too many people \n what r u guys doing now",

}, {
  "input" : "kerrykerryyy sorry I have a quick question hahahah \n u know in the paper Antonio accidentally sent us it says \n âYou are required to implement you own data structure, and you cannot therefore use built-in Java collections for these tasksâ \n and then the first question is about building a queue \n but then his solution uses Deque....? like can we do that hahaha \n Iâm so lost omg",
  "response" : "Lol I think he's just using it \n As an example \n Like for the test cases \n I think for the first question maybe u can do it like that but \n The second one u deffo have to do your own like linked list node stuff"
}, {
  "input" : "oh yeah right \n Wait is the second question basically what we did for the lab",
  "response" : "Yea basically \n But the solution I got for this paper works but when I tried to implement on the labs paper the same data structure it didn't ð"
}, {
  "input" : "wait Iâm so scared \n I donât remember anything \n This paper is so hard \n omg noooooooo my javaaaaa",
  "response" : "Actually if we got this paper and I hadn't seen it before I'd get like 10 marks"
}, {
  "input" : "yeah same \n Like i probably would only be able to do the first first question \n omg Iâm so screweeddd why did I start java so late \n And thereâs 3 hours of maths revision tomorrow morning",
  "response" : "Omg intellij tells you when there's a deadlock"
}, {
  "input" : "wait what",
  "response" : "But I do t know how to fix ._."
}, {
  "input" : "omg what is this \n java is so hard why did I think I can handle it",
  "response" : "Same for me, only start yesterday :("
}, {
  "input" : "I might actually fail java.... need to learn maths tomorrow morning too...... sigh \n I guess \n Passing would be difficult for me now \n wait whats this camera button for",

}, {
  "input" : "wow",
  "response" : "You've already passed programming anyways \n 23/24 \n 23/24"

  "input" : "no",

}, {
  "input" : "what",
  "response" : "Can't spell"
}, {
  "input" : "thats not passing programming \n java count as 42% \n :( \n im actually so screwed",
  "response" : "It's okay, if u think about it \n U still have C"

  "input" : "time to learn how to implement fine-grained list stuff again",
  "response" : "And if we work together"
}, {
  "input" : "omg hahahahaha",
  "response" : "We will get 100% in c project :p"
}, {
  "input" : "omg it would be nice if it actually happens \n ok its just easier to memorise the code now \n im just gonna \n omg \n what if those tree stuff comes up",
  "response" : "Did u do the tree past paper? \n I hope Antonio doesn't have enough time to write another past paper ._. ðð"
}, {
  "input" : "wait thereâs a tree past paper??? \n omg I canât even do this paper \n Iâm so screwed omg",
  "response" : "The one Robert helped me with ðð \n Remember??"
}, {
  "input" : "OMG hahahahaha \n that was their final interim??? \n omg I wanna die \n How do u even implement this queue",
  "response" : "Yupp, I kinda get the concurrency stuff now but I haven't looked at anything else ._."
}, {
  "input" : "omgggg",
  "response" : "I implemented like 4 threads safe queues today ._."
}, {
  "input" : "Can I see ur code..... \n I looked at Jasonâs but",
  "response" : "Yupp"
}, {
  "input" : "Itâs kind of",
  "response" : "Mine is pretty clean ð \n Gimme 2 secs"
}, {
  "input" : "Idk how to describe it \n can I seeeee \n Thank youuu",
  "response" : "I can explain if u need"
}, {
  "input" : "Wait yours is doubly linked? \n wait why do u guys all use while true",
  "response" : "Yea it makes the implementation really easy"
}, {
  "input" : "doubly linked list?",
  "response" : "Antonio used while true ðð \n Kinda, basically u have 2 null nodes \n One for the start and one of the end \n And it's optimistic locking \n You know if u want to add a node, u have to lock the last node and the second last node \n Whilst if u want to poll a node u have to lock the first and the second node"
}, {
  "input" : "Why do u need to lock the second last one \n yeah I just donât get why u need the previous node",
  "response" : "So \n Think about it \n If the second last node is not locked \n Then you can remove it right? \n And that'll be bad \n So for add node u need the one before and the one after the new node to be locked"
}, {
  "input" : "if the second last one isnât locked then u can remove it",
  "response" : "Yup whilst the add is still going on"
}, {
  "input" : "ohhh itâs because u have a tail node right \n Like itâs always there",
  "response" : "Yeah"
}, {
  "input" : "ahh icic",
  "response" : "And that makes the base case easy too"
}, {
  "input" : "Jason uses one first one and like a pointer ish thing \n So I got a bit confused",
  "response" : "Yea, he points both of them to the first node"
}, {
  "input" : "and then I donât get his while loop ahha with all the continue and stuff \n Okok lemme try understand ur code haha",
  "response" : "Lemme know if anything confuses u \n There's a few nuisances that u need to understand or else it sometimes doesn't work"
}, {
  "input" : "hahhaa thanks \n wait so \n why do we need to use while true \n So it keeps trying?",
  "response" : "Do u know what optimistic locking is"
}, {
  "input" : "ummmm I usually do up to fine grained \n ð¤¦ð»ââï¸",
  "response" : "I think optimistic is easier than fine-grain lik \n Lol"
}, {
  "input" : "wait what",
  "response" : "But basically what it is is"
}, {
  "input" : "Isnât optimistic the one that u need a flag or sth \n Check valid or sth",
  "response" : "You get the next node \n And then u lock the next node and the previous nofet \n But during the time \n When u assign the next node \n And when u lock both nodes \n The next node could've changed right"
}, {
  "input" : "u insert the new node between the two u lock right",
  "response" : "Yea"
}, {
  "input" : "Wait what the next node can be changed? Isnât it the one passed into the method call",
  "response" : "Not the new node \n The node the first node was originally pointing to \n Say a remove happened or smth \n Which is why u need to check that after the lock \n The second node is still the next of the first \n Because if it isn't then u have to start again, which is why there is while(true)"
}, {
  "input" : "but once u lock them",
  "response" : "But if it is then both nodes are locked so u can do whatever, so in this case it's adding a node"
}, {
  "input" : "Then u can ensure that the second one wonât be removed?",
  "response" : "Yea once u lock both \n But there's a time period right both u lock it \n Like when I assign secondnode to first.next"
}, {
  "input" : "then why do u need to use previous node \n Canât u",
  "response" : "There's a time when none of the nodes are locked right?"
}, {
  "input" : "yeah yeah like thereâs a time difference between the two nodes r locked \n right....?",
  "response" : "Wdym"
}, {
  "input" : "like canât u check that the second node hasnât been changed by just",
  "response" : "The time difference between when second=first.next"
}, {
  "input" : "Using next",
  "response" : "And the first node gets locked \n Nd the second node gets locked \n Basically \n The reason why it's doubly linked \n Is mainly for adding at the end of the queue \n If it wasn't doubly linked \n Then you'd have to traverse from the start each time right?"
}, {
  "input" : "yeah... \n Ohh cos Antonio does it by adding another method that finds the position \n icic \n Doubly linked then u donât have to do that? \n U just get the last one and find the first one by using previous node?",
  "response" : "Problem with doubly linked list is like deadlocks"
}, {
  "input" : "hmmm?",
  "response" : "I think like"
}, {
  "input" : "yeah cos u can traverse it both ways right....",
  "response" : "Yea \n But it's fine for queues"
}, {
  "input" : "hmmm? \n then what is it not fine for \n Omg sorry Iâm like really stupid haha",
  "response" : "Like optimistic locking? \n Basically doubly linked concurrent data structures are a pain to implement"
}, {
  "input" : "yeah thatâs what I thought \n But then \n singly linked is like \n omg I just wanna like memorise one way to do it hahaha \n but then Jasonâs way Iâm like so confused \n Antonioâs way is so long \n doubly linked Iâm worried I might implement it wrong \n Life is sad â¹ï¸",
  "response" : "I don't think they'll ask for a doubly linked one"
}, {
  "input" : "yeah but if itâs one way",
  "response" : "I can send u my singly linked list one \n If u want"
}, {
  "input" : "wait u have both?",
  "response" : "It uses finegrain"
}, {
  "input" : "yes please....?",
  "response" : "Yea I managed to just debug it"
}, {
  "input" : "that would be good enough for me now \n I think optimistic might be too hard for me ð¤¦ð»ââï¸",
  "response" : "It's kinda in the social media format ðð \n Delete and add should be similar with the two try finallys"
}, {
  "input" : "ahh this is the \n own with keys right",
  "response" : "No keys \n But it's priority \n Actually it is keys \n Lol"
}, {
  "input" : "isnât the integer \n oh \n Ok",
  "response" : "But I think it's really easy to change"
}, {
  "input" : "wait so the \n key point is \n To check if the second node \n Has been changed or not \n Right \n right.... \n like when u try to add it",
  "response" : "For the queue one \n Yesh \n But for fine grain locking"
}, {
  "input" : "is it not the same for lists",
  "response" : "U dont need to check"
}, {
  "input" : "???? Why not \n Oh cos u lock them when u traverse the lists \n ?",
  "response" : "U traverse one way \n So one operation can't over take the other"
}, {
  "input" : "hmmm \n Ok lemme just stick to \n one way \n thanks Kerryyy hope Iâm not bothering u too muchð¤¦ð»ââï¸ I feel so bad omg \n time to learn coding \n In one hour so I donât oversleep tomrorow",
  "response" : "Nono, I feel like I'm learning by explaining ð, good luck for tomorrow \n Wake me up if I can't tomorrow ._."

  "input" : "wait if itâs to do with setting C flag \n Surely tst would behave the same as and Iâm that case \n In that case*",
  "response" : "And case?"
}, {
  "input" : "like \n If itâs just to do with setting flags \n and and tst are defined to be the same \n then if and works why wouldnât tst work",
  "response" : "Lemme check and"
}, {
  "input" : "thanksss",
  "response" : "And works fine... I'm so confused"
}, {
  "input" : "waittttt \n cos if u look at the function \n setcond (updating flag) is defined to be the same for everything",

  "input" : "only for tst?",

  "input" : "??? \n howww",

  "input" : "oh wait really ahha Iâm sorry \n Like when we initialise it",
