It uses static polymorphism to resolve it so it doesnt even consider whatever I put in RayTracingRenderer nvm I managed it, though its kinda disgusting behaviour also question 5 just doesnt compile like at all okay nvm that new problems I dont understand how the fuck doees inheritance of parameterised variables work for the ellipse question when I change the variable for some reason the change just isnt registered if I do it in the loggedellipse even though the rest of the function is running"

}, {
  "input" : "Do what?",

  "input" : "um that sounds confusing how can you have a public class? what does that even mean? I know constructors can be private but not classes",
  "response" : "Yeah ignore that part It's a private method to access the clads Class"
}, {
  "input" : "So you're making an anonymous class which extends Iterator which has a private var that you're using where?",
  "response" : "I'm using it in bag Also I'm now getting an illegal start of declaration when I didn't forget the = Oh nvm lol"

  "input" : "Have classes be implemented as functions? Is that what you mean?",
  "response" : "No more that instead of writing classes and then what methods they have, you only write methods, then subscribe classes to them So in scala like notation def add(X: Int) : Int = \n   Class Int { this + X}\n   Class bigInt ... And so on This would be silly"
}, {
  "input" : "Interesting - is that how it works in kotlin? Actually that's kind of how it works in scala: with typeclasses for instance Show is a typeclass, and it specifies that anything which belongs to the Show typeclass supports a method (lowercase) show :: Show a => a -> String then if you want to make a thing a show, all you do is define the show function for whatever instance Show a => Show [a] where\n    show [] = \"[]\"\n    show (x:xs) = \"[\" ++ show x ++ concat (map (\\x -> ',' : show x) xs) ++ \"]\" or something like that",

Ignore the above So type casts are like an -able trait Foldable etc"
}, {
  "input" : "Functors are parametric classes (or in Haskell types) (parametric because they have a type variable like [a] or Maybe a) which you can map over, so obv the [a] type is a functor - for lists it's map but more generally it's fmap\nfmap :: (Functor f) => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b\nIt also had to have certain rules notably\nâ¢ fmap id = id\nâ¢ fmap (f.g) = fmap f.fmap g",

  "input" : "I guess in java the way to do it would be to create an interface (or Scala trait) and have other classes extend that trait",

  "input" : "How readable to you find Haskell documentation?",

  "input" : "I'm actually torn here - I want things to be pure sooo bad ð­",
  "response" : "So you can still do all your ugly Oop shit But you can also be pure if you want All the actually useful stuff would be pure The main reason I'd prefer my thing Is that it would be much clearer what method your class would use In cases of overridden or overloaded methods Maybe you can have a pure trait For methods"

  "input" : "The issue then is that every classes' methods are spread all around the place kinda",
  "response" : "Yeah ik You could have a converter that switches it for documentations sake"
